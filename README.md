# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
Course Project in the Coursera: Getting and Cleaning Data

The files in this repository represents my output for the final project in the Coursera Course: Getting and Cleaning Data Course under the Data Science specialization track. The run_analysis.R script contains the following instructions:

**Download and unzip source data if it doesn't exist.
**Read data.
**Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
**Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
**Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
**Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names.
**Create a second, independent tidy set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
**Write the tidy data set to a text file.
